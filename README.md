☂️ Umbrella Customizer

The Umbrella Customizer is an interactive web tool built for an umbrella seller who caters to corporate brands. It allows customers to instantly preview their company logos on different colored umbrellas before placing an order.

The project enables users to:

Upload their brand logo

Preview it on the umbrella (positioned at the bottom area)

Switch between umbrella colors (Pink, Blue, Yellow)

Experience a dynamic theme change across the UI based on the selected color

🚀 Features

✅ Logo Upload & Preview – Upload your company logo and see it instantly applied to the umbrella.
✅ Dynamic Color Swatch – Choose from Pink, Blue, and Yellow umbrellas. The umbrella image and overall tool theme change accordingly.
✅ Real-time Customization – No page reloads; all interactions are handled smoothly with JavaScript.
✅ Simple & Lightweight – Built using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or external libraries.
✅ Responsive Design – Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

🧰 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure and markup

CSS3 – Styling and color themes

JavaScript (Vanilla) – DOM manipulation, image handling, and interactivity

🎨 Color Options

The umbrella comes in three available colors:

🌸 Pink

💙 Blue

💛 Yellow

Selecting a color updates both the umbrella image and the UI theme to match the chosen color palette.

🧑‍💻 How It Works

Open the Umbrella Customizer webpage.

Choose a color from the color swatches.

Upload your logo (PNG/JPEG recommended).

Instantly preview the logo placed on the umbrella.
