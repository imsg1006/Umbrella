☂️ Custom Umbrella Customizer

A simple yet interactive umbrella customization tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows corporate clients to preview their logos on umbrellas instantly in different colors — Pink, Blue, and Yellow.

🚀 Features
🎨 Color Customization

Choose between Pink, Blue, and Yellow umbrellas.

The entire theme of the page dynamically updates to match the selected color for a consistent look.

🖼️ Logo Upload

Upload your brand’s .png or .jpg logo for an instant on-umbrella preview.

Automatically positions the logo at the bottom center of the umbrella.

Supports file sizes up to 5MB.

📸 Download Preview (New)

Instantly download the customized umbrella preview as an image file.

Ideal for sharing with teams or clients before placing bulk orders.

✨ Smooth Umbrella Animation (New)

When the umbrella loads or its color changes, a subtle fade and scale animation brings it to life.

Creates a modern, fluid experience while switching between colors.

🌗 Shadow & Depth Effects (New)

Added realistic shadow effects for the umbrella and UI components.

Enhances depth perception and gives the tool a clean, premium look.

🧠 Tech Stack

HTML5 – structure and markup

CSS3 – layout, color themes, and animation

JavaScript (Vanilla) – logic for color switching, logo upload, and download

No libraries or frameworks were used — everything is built from scratch for maximum performance and simplicity.
